## three-act storyline generated from its lore — so from minute one no two
## players are on the same mission unless they chose the same blood.
## Chains register as dynamic quests in QuestManager; YOUR race's Act I is
## auto-accepted at startup. Other races' chains exist in the world but are
## gated to their own (equivalent exchange can buy a foreign chain open).

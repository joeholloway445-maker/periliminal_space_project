## Autoloaded as "WordOfMouth". The personalized-NPC layer over Hope's
## database: how you treat the world's people comes back to you — but as
## WORD OF MOUTH, not a hive mind. Each interaction (kind, cruel,
## flirtatious, a marriage proposal) is remembered by that specific NPC
## immediately, and RUMORS about you spread outward gradually: every NPC
## has their own fixed gossip threshold (hash-seeded, so the same NPC is
## always equally plugged-in), and only starts treating you differently
## once enough has happened for the talk to plausibly reach them.
##
## Everything recorded here also flows into Hope.record — so Knoll knows,
## and the Periliminal reads it when it sets your difficulty.

class_name SkillData
## The skill system's data layer — ESO-shaped but native to our cosmology:
##
##  SKILL LINES come from what you ARE, not what you picked up:
##   - Your FRAME line (all 20 frames each carry a full line: 5 actives +
##     1 ultimate + 3 passives). Your frame is your primary line; the
##     ascended frame's line powers your SECOND bar.
##   - Your RACE line (passive-heavy, 2 actives + 1 ultimate).
##   - Your FACTION line (3 actives + 1 ultimate; Factionless get the
##     Lone Wolf line).
##   - The LIMINAL ARTS — the universal line every walker learns, because
##     everyone has stood in the between at least once.
##
##  MORPHS: every active, at rank IV, refracts into one of two variants —
##  lore says a skill practiced long enough starts perceiving YOU back,
##  and it has to choose what it sees. Morph names/effects derive from the
##  skill plus the morphing archetype (offense refraction vs utility
##  refraction).
##
##  Lines are GENERATED from the existing data (frame stat profiles + lore
##  strings, race passives, faction identities) so all 20 frames, 20 races
##  and 4 allegiances have complete lines with consistent depth — then
##  hand-tuned entries can override any generated one later.

## ── ELEMENTS: the six entity forces, channelable by EVERY line ────────────
## The Marvel principle: a skill line is a fighting STYLE; the element is
## the superhuman FORCE behind it. Any line — unarmed, gunplay, frame,
## race, faction, liminal — can be attuned to any of the six entity
## categories, changing its color, sound, and combat rider. Attunement is
## per-line, swappable outside combat (SkillManager.attune_line).

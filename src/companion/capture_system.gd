## Autoloaded as "CaptureSystem". The rule Joe set: you don't catch
## entities by tossing a ball at a wild one — you catch them by
## DEFEATING them. Solo, or with Hope's help. The harder the fight, the
## more special the bond, and rare stages stay rare instead of flooding
## the world.
##
## The catch is NOT automatic. When a player-triggered defeat happens,
## roll a chance that scales with:
##   - How much of your own HP you brought to the end of the fight
##     (a clean win reads as "you earned this one").
##   - Hope's bond (a more-Kindled Hope helps you land the moment).
##   - Rarity/stage of the entity (higher = harder = rarer catch).
##   - Personal difficulty (Hope profile + word of mouth) via Periliminal.
## The player is told, either way — the whole point is that the moment
## feels like a moment, not a silent inventory increment.

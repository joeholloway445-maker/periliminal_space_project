class_name RaceNames
## One substance, many names — what a race is CALLED depends on which depth
## you are standing in.
##
## This is the answer to the two-roster split (docs/OMNIDEX.md): the Omni Dex
## roster and the canon roster were never two sets of races, they are two
## registers of naming for the same twenty substances. You are Crownless —
## that is what you are, and what almost everyone calls you. The Metroplex
## files you as a Terran on a work visa because its forms have no box for
## Crownless. The Liminal, older and set in its ways, still says Keth.
##
## It fits what the lens already does. A being's appearance is a function of
## who is looking; this makes its NAME a function of where you are looking
## from. Nobody is lying — a Terran and a Keth are the same person, filed by
## two bureaucracies that disagree about what matters.
##
## Registers:
##   civil       Hyperliminal / Supraliminal — casino floor and Metroplex
##               paperwork. Mundane, administrative, deliberately boring.
##   true        THE PRIMARY NAME. The Omni Dex register — ability-led, what
##               a thing demonstrably is. This is what players call each
##               other and what the UI shows by default.
##   canon       The old working roster (Keth, Lumari, ...), kept because it
##               is the id every body, gene and material keys on, and because
##               it still reads as the Liminal's own older vocabulary.
##
## `canon` is the id everything else keys on (bodies, genes, materials). The
## other two are display strings only, so renaming is free and no gameplay
## data moves.

## Omni Dex names are the default everywhere; the civil register is the
## paperwork name the mundane layers use, and the canon register survives as
## the Liminal's older vocabulary.

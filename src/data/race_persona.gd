class_name RacePersona
## Who a race IS, past what they look like. HumanRaceArchetypes gives each
## canon race a body and a material; this gives them a temperament, a way of
## MOVING, a voice, mannerisms, an aesthetic, and personality leanings — so a
## Volt reads as a jittery live-wire, a Ferros as a rigid martial snob, and a
## Keth as a hooded opportunist even before anyone speaks.
##
## Keyed by canon race name (CanonRaces.RACES), same register as
## HumanRaceArchetypes. Every field is optional; missing ones fall back to the
## neutral defaults in movement()/voice(), so an unlisted race is simply calm
## and average rather than broken.
##
## What is wired where:
##   movement{}  -> PeriHumanRig.apply_persona(): idle_energy, gait_cadence,
##                  posture_lean, swagger actually change how the body stands,
##                  fidgets, and walks.
##   voice{}     -> pitch/rasp/cadence for whatever plays a race's barks.
##   style[]     -> aesthetic tags a wardrobe/gallery layer can lean on
##                  (hood, ornament, tech, plate…).
##   mannerisms[], traits[], quirk -> flavor for dialogue, the Dex, and NPC AI.

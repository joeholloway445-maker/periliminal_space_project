class_name OmniDex
## The Master Omni Dex roster, transcribed from the design workbook
## (Races / Frames / Morph_Rigs sheets) into engine-readable data.
##
## This is the authored source of truth for the 20 x 20 x 20 = 8,000
## build identities. It is deliberately kept separate from
## `race_lore.gd` / `human_race_archetypes.gd`, which describe a
## DIFFERENT, earlier 20-race roster (Keth / Lumari / Vex / ...) that
## the PeriHuman genome system is currently keyed to. The two rosters
## have not been reconciled — see docs/OMNIDEX.md before wiring this
## into character creation.
##
## Faction ids here already match the PerceptionSystem RPS wheel
## (sovereign_crown > wildlands_ascendants > veiled_current > ...).

		"description": "Futuristic humanoid glowing with solar energy, sleek armor, ambient light aura.",
		"lore": "Lumenari bodies bank ambient light and release it in disciplined bursts. At peak Focus a Lumenari unleashes Radiant Pulse, a small AoE burst that scatters anything pressing too close — but the same light that empowers them gutters in darkness.",

		"description": "Urban survivor humanoid, bio-urban mutation, toxic-stained clothing, gritty neon background.",
		"lore": "Forged in collapsed undercities, Gutterkin metabolisms turn hazard into harvest — Hazard Conversion lets contaminated terrain restore their Focus. Sterile, clean zones do the opposite, leaving them sluggish to regenerate.",

		"drawback": "Incoming damage rises after ally death",
		"description": "Ethereal, smoky translucent humanoid, floating in dark mist.",

		"description": "Digital humanoid, holographic patterns, circuit-like glowing tattoos",
		"lore": "Echoes run on borrowed code, slipping Passive System Hacks into nearby networks without a sound. But they are still code at heart, and an EMP leaves them stuttering far worse than flesh ever would.",

		"drawback": "Sleep cycle fluctuation",
		"description": "Adaptive humanoid, soft glowing skin, subtle morphing features.",

		"drawback": "Faction hostility events",

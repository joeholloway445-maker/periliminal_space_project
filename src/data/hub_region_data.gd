## Hand-authored "always generated" hub regions inside the Supraliminal layer.
## Everything outside these bounds (in chunk-grid coordinates) is generated
## lazily by ProceduralRegionGenerator the first time a player enters it —
## see DiscoveryManager. Hubs are never regenerated or influence-painted by
## the discover mechanic; they're the fixed faction-hub anchors.

## DFW Metroplex layout: Arlington is the neutral PvE center (Marketplace,
## Arena, Workshop/University, Space Station districts inside it) and the
## starting hub for the factionless. Dallas, Fort Worth and Denton are the
## three faction hubs, roughly matching real geography on the chunk grid
## (Fort Worth west, Dallas east, Denton north, Arlington between).
## All hub interiors are PvE; every chunk outside hub bounds is PvP and
## claimable via TerritoryControl.

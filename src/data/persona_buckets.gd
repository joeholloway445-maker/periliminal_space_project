class_name PersonaBuckets
## The plug-and-play content engine behind race personality.
##
## The problem: giving 20 races distinct chatter, greetings, taunts, musings,
## farewells, flirts, and story lines is a LOT of writing — and copying a pool
## onto every race wastes memory and duplicates edits.
##
## The solution here: content lives in shared, tag-keyed BUCKETS, loaded once
## as constants. A race maps to ONE tag per axis (its "mood" for temperament
## channels, its "stance" for the story channel), and every channel resolves
## through that tag. So a dozen mood buckets cover all twenty races, and adding
## a race is just picking its tags — no new prose required. When a race DOES
## deserve bespoke lines, drop them in RACE_OVERRIDES and they win; everything
## else keeps falling back to the shared bucket. That's the "simple templates,
## plug-and-play buckets, per channel AND per race" shape, and it's memory-light
## because the pools are shared, not per-instance.
##
## To add a channel: add its pool dict + an entry in CHANNELS/CHANNEL_AXIS.
## To give one race unique lines: RACE_OVERRIDES[canon][channel] = [ ... ].
## To retune a whole temperament: edit its bucket once; every race on that tag
## updates.

## Where each race stands on the Theory of Everything — the discovery that one
## law underlies every reality layer, and the war over what to DO with that.
## The Liminal's first finders realized the layers could be fused into a
## single, total state — godhood, in effect, shared and absolute. They never
## agreed on whether that fusion was worth having, and while they argued, the
## chance passed. What's left are the two Solutions and the people still
## arguing them (see docs/STORY_SINGULARITY.md for the full premise):
##   singularity      The Solution of Everything — collapse the layers into
##                     one total state. Unity by addition.
##   anti_singularity  The Solution of Nothing — refuse the collapse. Nothing
##                     is fused, nothing is lost; the many stay many.

##                     Solution it justifies.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------- origins

## Not every race is from the same world, or the same PART of one — the races
## are grouped into ORIGINS, distinct cradle-realities that only became
## neighbors once the Liminal connected them. An origin is the unit that
## carries history: two races from the same origin already know each other;
## two from origins with old grudges arrive as strangers who are already
## rivals, whatever the player does next. This is the hook for storylines
## that "complement or contradict" across races, and the seam DLC plugs new
## races/origins into (see "Adding a DLC race" in docs/PERSONA_SYSTEM.md).
const ORIGINS := {
	"ash_forged": {
		"name": "The Ash-Forged",
		"blurb": "A harsh, volcanic forge-world where survival meant hardening — into warriors, into iron, into blood-discipline. Martial, severe, quick to claim territory as the only safety that lasts.",
	},

		"blurb": "Not a world so much as the gap between worlds — a lightless reality its natives learned to exist partway outside of. Patient, watchful, comfortable with not fully arriving anywhere.",

	},
	"glass_reaches": {
		"name": "The Glass Reaches",
		"blurb": "An ancient crystalline and glacial world, old before most others had a first age. Its natives measure time the way others measure distance, and rarely feel rushed by anything.",
	},
	"storm_wrought": {
		"name": "The Storm-Wrought",
		"blurb": "A world of perpetual electrical storms where survival meant fusing with the current instead of hiding from it — machine and organism blurred early and never fully separated again.",

		"name": "The Starfall Expanse",

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- factions

## Which of the three human factions each race is historically tied to. This is
## a SEPARATE axis from STANCE_OF on purpose: the Theory war is ancient and
## cosmic, between the races themselves; the factions are recent and human —
## SovereignCrown, WildlandsAscendant, and VeiledCurrent formed only after
## humanity found the Liminal and, rather than understand what they'd found,
## moved to claim it. A race's faction tie reflects which claim recruited or
## absorbed them, not which Solution they believe in — a race can be tied to
## SovereignCrown and still privately hold the Solution of Nothing.
## Factionless is NOT a fourth claim faction and never a historical tie — it's
## the absence of one, worn by races no claim ever recruited, and by every new
## character before they pledge (see PlayerProfile.set_faction: once a
## character leaves Factionless the choice is permanent, no swapping back or
## sideways). A race simply omitted here is born Factionless by default —
## that's how Nyx, Kryos, Chimera, Etherea, and Azhul read. Provisional and
## overridable; a DLC race just needs one entry here (or none).

# ------------------------------------------------------------ layer arcs

## The six reality layers (docs/LORE_FOUNDATION.md) don't share one plot —
## a player spends most of a session in one or two layers, so each layer
## carries its own grounded storyline, and the Theory of Everything /
## Solution of Everything vs Nothing (STANCE_OF, STORY) is the myth that
## runs underneath and eventually threads all of them together, not a
## seventh plot competing with them. Scaffold only — `hook` is one line
## naming where that layer's local story starts and how it touches the
## Theory war; the actual quest content is a separate, later pass.
## `arc_status()` below reads this the same way stance()/origin_name() read
## their tables, so wiring a layer's real storyline into dialogue/quests
## later is a data change here, not new code.

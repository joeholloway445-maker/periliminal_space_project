| `godot/src/vehicles/water_vehicle.gd`, `air_vehicle.gd`, `space_vehicle.gd` | Original — no equivalent official Godot demo exists for buoyancy or flight (unlike VehicleBody3D for land, Godot has no built-in boat/aircraft physics node), so these are from-scratch arcade models | MIT (code) |

**PeriHuman policy:** characters and NPCs **ship inside the game**. Players
never install Unreal, MakeHuman, DAZ, or Character Creator. Slots:

- `peri_human_player.glb` / `metahuman_player.glb` — local player
- `peri_human_npc.glb` / `metahuman_npc.glb` — generic NPC
- `peri_human_<race_id>.glb` / `metahuman_<race_id>.glb` — optional per-race
- `variants/metahuman_npc/*.glb` (+ peri/npc_human pools) — NPC outfit variety

**Current look (studio bake):** MPFB2 humans with textured skin, eyes,
teeth, brows/lashes, hair, and fitted clothes (`scripts/bake_mpfb_characters.py`).
DFW hubs use OSM2World shells when `osm2world_<hub>.glb` is present.
Players never install Blender / MPFB / OSM2World. Archive: `interim/tps_player.glb`.

**Vehicle asset slots** (AssetLibrary.instance_or — drop a `.glb` in
`assets/models/` named for the slot, zero code changes needed):
- `vehicle_car_body.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney Car Kit `sedan.glb`). Wheels
  stay procedural placeholders; swapping in a full external car rig with
  matching wheel positions is a deeper integration than a body-mesh swap,
  not yet wired.
- `vehicle_boat_body.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney Watercraft Kit `boat-speed-a.glb`)
- `vehicle_spacecraft_body.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney Space Kit `craft_racer.glb`)
- `vehicle_aircraft_body.glb` — ✅ filled (Quaternius Ultimate Spaceships `Bob`)

**City asset slots** (MegaCityBuilder / BuildingBuilder):
- `city_tower.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Commercial `building-skyscraper-c.glb`)
- `city_lowrise.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Commercial `building-e.glb`)
- `city_house.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Suburban `building-type-f.glb`)
- `city_industrial.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Industrial `building-e.glb`)
- `road_segment.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Roads `road-straight.glb`)
- `sidewalk.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Roads `tile-low.glb`)
- `streetlight.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Roads `light-square.glb`)
- `city_prop.glb` — ✅ filled (Kenney City Kit Suburban `planter.glb`)

**Resolved: `AssetLibrary.instance_variant(slot, rng)`** now picks
deterministically from a per-slot pool (`godot/data/asset_variants.json`
→ `assets/models/variants/<slot>/*.glb`), so the same city rebuilds
identically (same seed → same picks) while different buildings on the
same block use different meshes. `BuildingBuilder.build()`/`build_osm()`
thread the existing per-city `rng` through it; `BreakableProp` gets a
`variant_seed` set by its placer. `instance(slot)` / `instance_or()` are
unchanged and still work for every slot that has no variant pool.

Current pool sizes (all CC0, all from the packs below — well short of
what each pack actually ships, kept modest for repo size):

| Slot | Variants pulled in | Pack |
|---|---|---|
| `city_tower` | 5 of 5 skyscrapers | Kenney City Kit (Commercial) |
| `city_lowrise` | 6 of 14 buildings | Kenney City Kit (Commercial) |
| `city_house` | 8 of 21 houses | Kenney City Kit (Suburban) |
| `city_industrial` | 8 of 20 buildings | Kenney City Kit (Industrial) |
| `city_prop` | 3 (planter + 2 tree sizes) | Kenney City Kit (Suburban) |
| `vehicle_car_body` | 5 (sedan/sedan-sports/taxi/suv/police — same wheelbase class as the existing procedural wheel offsets) | Kenney Car Kit |
| `vehicle_spacecraft_body` | 5 (racer + 4 speeders) | Kenney Space Kit |
| `tree` | 6 pines / detailed trees | Kenney Nature Kit |
| `rock` | 5 rocks / tall stones | Kenney Nature Kit |
| `crystal` | 4 faceted gem clusters | Procedural bake |
| `creature` | 6 monsters/animals | Quaternius Monsters / Animals |
| `player_cat` / `npc_cat` | 3–4 fur variants | Procedural bake |
| `vehicle_aircraft_body` | 1 (Bob) | Quaternius Spaceships |
| `apartment_prop` | 6 furniture pieces | Kenney Furniture Kit |
| `ruin_pillar` | 5 castle pieces | Kenney Castle Kit |
| `metahuman_npc` / `peri_human_npc` / `npc_human` | 5 skin/hair/cloth variants | Blender Studio Human Base Meshes |

`road_segment`/`sidewalk` stay single-file on purpose — road tiles have
to interlock at fixed pivots/edges, and swapping them per-instance without
matching connector geometry would break the street grid, not just look
different. `vehicle_boat_body` also stays single-file (Watercraft Kit has
45 boats if a future pass wants to extend it the same way).

Further headroom in the same already-vetted CC0 packs, if a future pass
wants to go further:

| Pack | Total variants available | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Kenney City Kit (Commercial)](https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-commercial) | 14 full buildings + 5 skyscrapers + 16 low-detail | CC0 |
| [Kenney City Kit (Industrial)](https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-industrial) | 20 buildings + chimneys/tanks | CC0 |
| [Kenney City Kit (Suburban)](https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-suburban) | 21 houses + fences/paths/trees | CC0 |
| [Kenney City Kit (Roads)](https://kenney.nl/assets/city-kit-roads) | 70+ road/intersection/signage tiles | CC0 |
| [Kenney Car Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/car-kit) | 13 vehicles (also delivery/truck/race — different wheelbase class, riskier to drop into the fixed wheel rig without visual QA) | CC0 |
| [Kenney Watercraft Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/watercraft-kit) | 45 boats | CC0 |
| [Kenney Space Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-kit) | 6 craft + full station/corridor kit | CC0 |

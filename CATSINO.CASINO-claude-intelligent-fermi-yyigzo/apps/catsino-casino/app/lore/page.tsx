  world: `PAWS VEGAS — a city built on luck, speed, and the eternal battle for style.

Once a sleepy desert outpost, Paws Vegas was transformed overnight when the SovereignCrown arrived and declared it the capital of the new world order. Within a decade, five districts rose from the sand: each one a battlefield for the four great factions.

The slots spin. The reels turn. The cats race.

And somewhere beneath it all — in the roots, in the currents, in the void — something watches.`,

  districts: [
    { id: "paw_vegas",     name: "Paws Vegas Central", icon: "🎰", lore: "The crown jewel of the city. Neon towers and slot machines stretch as far as the eye can see. The SovereignCrown's casino empire began here — and all the other factions followed." },
    { id: "cat_coliseum",  name: "Cat Coliseum",       icon: "⚔️", lore: "Ancient before the city existed. Carved from black obsidian by the original Wildlands settlers. Now Paws Vegas' premier combat arena. Only the strong endure." },
    { id: "neon_alley",    name: "Neon Alley",          icon: "🏁", lore: "The VeiledCurrent's territory. Neon canals, water races, and underground betting dens. The fastest cats in the world come here to prove their speed." },
    { id: "cat_forest",    name: "Cat Forest",          icon: "🌿", lore: "The Wildlands' sacred territory. Ancient trees, hidden clearings, and companions who haven't seen the city in decades. Quests begin here. Legends are born here." },
    { id: "arcade_galaxy", name: "Arcade Galaxy",       icon: "👾", lore: "No one knows who built it. The Arcade Galaxy appeared one morning — a floating platform above the city. The factions all claim ownership. None have proven it." },
  ],

  factions: [
    { id: "SovereignCrown",     icon: "👑", color: "text-yellow-400", lore: "They arrived first. They built fastest. They rule hardest. The SovereignCrown is Paws Vegas' founding faction — a coalition of elite cats who built the city's casino empire." },
    { id: "WildlandsAscendant", icon: "🌿", color: "text-green-400",  lore: "Before the city, there was the forest. The Wildlands faction traces its lineage to the original settlers of Cat Forest. They carry the Factionless label now like a weapon." },
    { id: "VeiledCurrent",      icon: "🌊", color: "text-blue-400",   lore: "You don't see the Current. You feel it. The VeiledCurrent emerged from Neon Alley's underground water network — born of smugglers, racers, and cats who preferred to operate unseen." },
    { id: "Factionless",        icon: "⚡", color: "text-gray-400",   lore: "Not a faction. An absence of one. Some cats answer to no one. A rare few — like The Unaffiliated — transcend faction entirely, earning the respect of all four without belonging to any." },
